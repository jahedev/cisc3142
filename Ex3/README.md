# Markdown Reference Guide (Part 2)

### Headings

Use "#", "##", or "###" for headings 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

### Horizontal Lines
---
Use "---" to create a horizontal line.

### Bullet/Number Points

- Use "-" followed by text to create bullet points.
- Use "1", "2", "3", ..., to create number points.

### Line Breaks

<br>
Use "\<br>" to create a line break.

### Bold/Italic

Use "\**" and "\**" in between a word or line of text to make it **bold**.

Use "\_" and "\_" in between a word or line of text to make it _italic_.


### Code Block

Use "\```" and "\```" with your code in between to create a code block; you can specify the language by puting it right after the first "```".

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Use "\`" and "\`" for `code within` a line of text.


### Tables

Tables
Use three or more hyphens "---" for column header, and use pipes "|" to separate each column.
